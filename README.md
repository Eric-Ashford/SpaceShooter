# SpaceShooter
# Launch the Space Defense Application located in the release folder to play.

This is a Space Battle shooter that attempts to recreate the oldschool arcade game Galaga.

Researched the Monogame framework to recreate a well known arcade game.

Incorporated Object-Oriented Programming in order to create a multitude of objects to be reused throughout the application. (Players, Enemies, Projectiles, etc.)
